# am-lang
A toy imperative programming language written as part of the course [Abstrakte Maschinen](http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/andi/185966.html).
It is an implementation of a register-based abstract (virtual) machine. Examples: [ackermann](benchmarks/ackermann.am), [fibonacci](benchmarks/fibonacci.am) and [prime](benchmarks/prime.am).
